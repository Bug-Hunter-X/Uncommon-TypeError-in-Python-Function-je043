This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Python involving unexpected TypeErrors when performing arithmetic operations with incompatible data types. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` offers a more robust solution. The error arises because a string and a list are used as the divisor, leading to a TypeError that might not be immediately obvious to all developers. The solution improves the input validation to explicitly prevent unexpected input and thereby avoids the runtime error.
